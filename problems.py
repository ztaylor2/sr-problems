"""Problem solutions.

1. Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question,
a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node
never differ by more than one.
2. Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
3. Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put the operators ‘+’, ‘-’, or nothing between
the numbers 1,2,...,9 (in this order) such that the result is 100. For example 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5
+ 6 + 78 + 9 = 100.
